Functionality :: Simple Application for posting and deleting messages. Where user can create his account and create his messages.

To run this application you just need to install meteor through terminal :: 

	curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

once you meteor install then clone this repository.

then navigate to "meteor-messaging-demo" directory and install all Npm packages using following command
